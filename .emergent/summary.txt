The previous AI engineer successfully initiated and progressed the development of a full-stack React, FastAPI, and MongoDB application. The core task was to clone the Eastern Empire website and implement several functional and visual enhancements. The engineer followed a structured workflow, starting with clarifying requirements, then building the frontend UI with mock data, setting up a basic backend with event seeding, and addressing SEO. A significant portion of the work involved iterative UI refinements based on explicit user feedback, including dynamic image galleries, logo integration, content reordering, and layout adjustments across various pages. The trajectory demonstrates a strong focus on pixel-perfect replication and user experience, with frequent use of the screenshot tool for verification. The latest tasks completed centered on further refining the Bio page's structure.

The primary goal is to build an exact clone of the Eastern Empire website () with pixel-perfect design, layout, colors, fonts, images, animations, and responsive behavior. Following this, several functional and UX enhancements are required:
1.  **Gigs & Events Page:** A prominent Gigs or Tour Dates page in the main navigation with a clear calendar for upcoming shows, including CTAs for tickets/RSVP.
2.  **Music Library & Listening Hub:** A dedicated Music or Releases page featuring original songs and covers, with embedded players (Spotify, Apple Music, Bandcamp) and links to major streaming platforms.
3.  **Band Bio & Member Profiles:** A detailed Bio page with a full biography, individual member photos, and write-ups.
4.  **Professional Services and Booking Page:** A Bookings or Hire Us page outlining services (String Quartets, 3-piece Instrumental/Vocal, Full Ensemble) for private/corporate events, specializing in South Asian weddings.
5.  **Stronger Homepage Visuals:** An updated high-quality, professional, and evocative video, similar to the original.
6.  **Clearer Main Goal:** More visible CTAs on the homepage (e.g., Book Eastern Empire, Get Tickets, Listen).
7.  **Organized Media:** Refinement of the Video page to organize content (Official Music Videos, Live Performances, Interviews).
8.  **SEO Best Practices:** Ensure the website adheres to SEO guidelines.
Ongoing refinements included removing branding, implementing a scrollable homepage image gallery with dots, adding logos to header/footer, adjusting video description text and layout, reordering sections on the homepage and Bio page, and refining social media icons.

-   Development of a comprehensive music library on the Music page, potentially integrating dynamically from streaming platform APIs or backend-managed data, beyond static embeds.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer's immediate preceding work focused on refining the Bio page. Specifically, the Our Journey section, which details the band's timeline, was reordered to appear at the very end of the page, after the Meet the Band (Band Members) section. Additionally, the What We Do section, which previously outlined the band's services, was completely removed from the Bio page, along with its associated unused import (). These changes streamline the Bio page content flow to: Hero → Main Bio → Band Members → Our Journey. This was verified through screenshots, confirming the removal and reordering were successfully implemented.

<optional_next_step>
Integrate the seeded event data from the backend to dynamically display upcoming shows on the Gigs page.
